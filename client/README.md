# Client

This client is developed with **Vainilla JS** using **Component helper** from "The Vanilla JS Toolkit" (https://vanillajstoolkit.com/helpers/component/). In this way, all the advantages offered by components (such as internal state, rendering, etc.) can be used without using a framework like React or Angular.

## It also uses 2 libraries: 
* jQuery to handle API calls and also to implement orderable lists with drag and drop.
* Semantic UI as a frontend styling guide.
